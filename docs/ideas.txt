Blood
    - Blood stays for Long duration (not perm)
    - enables blood skating
        - maintain velocity

Setting
    - enemies are humans from stone age > futuristic
    - character is a demon, evolving?

Further Parrallalization (or however its spelt)
    - can use query.par_for_each_mut to parraa.. systems like movement or colision
    - Bevy reccomends checking documentation for more info on when to use or not use parallelIterator over a normal Iterator.

Using circle-circle instead of aabb for collision detection
    - less accurate as most sprites aren't circular but might be much faster
