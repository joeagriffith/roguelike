Scoreboard

GameStates (use alien_cake_addict as example)
    - only run game systems in Playing state
    - enable easy restart on death

Hostile damage to Player
    - damage system
    - death system triggers GameState change

Fix Weapon system to allow better modularity

Blood
    - hostiles drop blood when killed, temporary
    - blood skating

Unit Sizing
    - Define Entity size and use SpriteBundle.sprite.custom_size to specify this on load
    - this could also be used for initialising boxcolliders

Event system
    - rather than check every frame for certain conditions, can clean up with events
    - player_damage event to check for death, update healthbar, update health   
    - kill_event to update scoreboard
    -
